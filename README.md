Simple Blog 
==========

This is a blog made for our first Epicodus Ruby on Rails Assesment.  On this site, a user is able to Make a post, and comment on a post.  

Install
-------

Fork the directory, run bundler from the command line, and then then start a rails server with <code>$ Rails Server</code>


Testing
-------

I built this blog following a controller spec pattern I learned from Tea Leaf Academy.  This ensures all of your actions are well tested before you begin implementing any other logic.  Making the final buildout of views pretty seemless.  I finished the buildout using Capybara feature specs I learned while attending Epicodus.  The perfect blend!
